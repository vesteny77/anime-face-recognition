# Face Recognition on Animated Characters

## Abstract
In recent years, we have seen an increased demand on facial recognition for cartoon characters: Disney studio, in 2020, adopted a deep learning model that recognizes specific character information and action sequences in its colossal content archive, which assist animators in their production process. In this paper, we will analyze 2 deep learning architectures, namely ResNet-50 and Inception v3, on face recognition of animated characters - we will evaluate the accuracy of outputs of the two models, determine the usefulness of feature extraction, visualize and compare filters and feature maps, and finally attempt to interpret the deep learning processes of the two models with an activation mapping tool, Grad-CAM.
